# NTLMv2-Key-Decryptor



This Python project simulates NTLMv2 authentication processes to derive and decrypt the session key used in SMB traffic decryption. It is educational and provides insight into NTLM's cryptographic mechanisms.

## Features
- Simulates NTLMv2 key exchange processes.
- Decrypts session keys using RC4.
- Outputs a decrypted session key for SMB traffic decryption.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- `pycryptodome`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NTLM-Key-Decryptor.git
